Use case for the technical discussion
cosnova GmbH Data Science â€“ Use Case
This use case is meant primarily to demonstrate your skill set and your ability to implement Data Science best practices and to communicate your findings clearly. The factual accuracy is not going to be judged. Please perform a topline analysis of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the beauty industry. The analysis should also contain a predictive component. Also include an executive summary of your findings. Please document your analysis in a Jupyter notebook hosted on GitHub. The Jupyter notebook should be self-contained, i.e., all results should be reproducible by executing the Jupyter notebook or following easy instructions. You may use any publicly available data sources; please include any supplemental material in the GitHub repository. The data collection and implementation within Jupyter should not take longer than 4h. You may make reasonable assumptions; please shortly justify your assumptions.
